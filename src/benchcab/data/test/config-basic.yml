# 
# Note, optional keys are available in this config file. See
# https://benchcab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/config_options/
# for documentation on all the available keys.

# This file is in YAML format. You can get information on the syntax here:
# https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#chapter-2-language-overview
# Quick tips:
# You need a space after the ":"
#
# It uses the same syntax as Python for:
#     - lists (aka sequences)
#     - dictionaries (aka mappings with key/value pairs)
#
# Strings can be given with or without double or single quotes.

# Uses minimal set of parameters required to run benchcab
